"If you fail, never give up because FAIL means "First Attempt In Learning". "Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough." "All of us do not have equal talent. But , all of us have an equal opportunity to develop our talents."A dream is not that which you see while sleeping, it is something that does not let you sleep.All of us do not have equal talent. But, all of us have an equal opportunity to develop our talents.
Don’t take rest after your first victory because if you fail in second, more lips are waiting to say that your first victory was just luck.am not handsome but I can give my hand to someone who needs help… Because beauty is required in the heart, not in face.The best brains of the nation may be found on the last benches of the classroom.Two rules for a peaceful life: Depression in failure should never go to heart, and ego in success should never go to the brain.</p>
